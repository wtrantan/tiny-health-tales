        name="Syed Ali"
        information="Hello, I am Syed! I am a 4th-year student at UC Merced pursuing a bachelor's degree in human biology with a minor in psychology. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and hanging out with my family and friends. After I graduate, I plan to study for the dental admission test and finalize my application for dental school. I joined the Tiny Health Tales Team because there is a lack of efficacy within the Central Valley regarding major health issues. As an aspiring dentist, the overall healthcare of my patients will be crucial as various systemic conditions such as diabetes and influenza can impact oral health or dental treatment. My focus within Tiny Health Tales will be to spread oral health awareness to minority populations within the Central Valley."
